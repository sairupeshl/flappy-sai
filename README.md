# Flappy Sai

A simple and fun Flappy Bird-inspired game built using Pygame and Python.

This is my first personal coding project, where I recreated the classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics. The game features:

- Bird movement with gravity and jumping
- Randomly generated obstacles (pipes) to navigate through
- Collision detection and scoring system
- Sound effects for each score and at the end
- Simple and colorful graphics

I built this project to practice Python programming and game development fundamentals. It helped me learn about event handling, game loops, and basic physics simulations.

## How to Play

- Press the **Spacebar** to make the bird flap and fly upward.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground.
- Try to fly as far as you can and beat your high score!
